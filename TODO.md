we need it to work when the LLM gives paths that are starting with root above CWD...

or do we.... no that's stupid cos it would lead to creating extra bad stuff.... 

ignore this.  and maybe enshrine somewhere why its important to actually not allow this.

and honestly why its important to make sure that the root of all file paths is precisely correct...  no smart looking around....
